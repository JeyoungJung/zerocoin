Simple, only one way of doing things, 

in javascript just to go through an array theres:
for, for each, for of, for in 

but in golang its just for loop, thats it.

This could be good because it would be easy to interprete what others did.

Also golang is complete, no need for other libraries like npm install, pip install etc...

learning curve is also not that high.
