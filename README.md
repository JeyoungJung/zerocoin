# zerocoin

### To start the program:

    go run main.go

### Flags

There are 2 flags:  

- mode
- port
  
For mode, you can either put `rest` for the REST API or `html` for the web explorer or `both` to run both (this flag is required).  
For port, you can put your port number (default is 4000).

Example: 

    go run main.go -mode=rest -port=5000
